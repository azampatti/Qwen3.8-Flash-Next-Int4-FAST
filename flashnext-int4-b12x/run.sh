# Mod: flashnext-int4-b12x
# Lets eugr's vllm-node-b12x image serve azampatti/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-125B-A5B-INT4-AutoRound across two GB10 nodes with
# the b12x RoCE all-reduce (recipe: recipes/qwen3.8-flash-next-int4-b12x.yaml).
#
# The launcher copies this folder into EVERY node's container and runs run.sh before the launch script; a non-zero exit
# aborts the launch, so a node with a missing or incomplete model never starts serving. Nothing outside the container is
# written, the Hugging Face cache is read-only here, and nothing is copied: the two folders below are symlinks + small JSON.
#
#   1. check the model in the HF cache (what ~/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Int4-FAST/setup.sh downloads)
#   2. build /workspace/flashnext/model     (served model view: PLE table indexed, config fields b12x needs)   build_views.py
#            /workspace/flashnext/draft-k10 (slim MTP draft folder, top-k 10, the head's own shared-expert width)
#   3. patch this container's vLLM: fp8 hybrid, int4 lm_head, loader index filter (required); draft x2, GDN fixes (optional)
#                                                                                                                 patch_b12x.py
